# TSLA-Stock-Analysis-
Tesla’s shares have been trading publicly since 2011 and many financial
analysts has forecasted for 6 to 9 years that this company would be on the verge of bankruptcy
for various reasons such as the difficulty of mass producing EVs, and the competition from EV
startups and other legacy automakers like General Motors and Ford. Lately,
many have realized they have been wrong on Tesla, as it has begun to disrupt the auto industry
and change the future of transportation. All of this has been reflected in Tesla’s share price
which has soared almost 800% since last year. In this project, we will examine how Tesla’s stock
performance is in comparison to the overall market starting from 2019 up to Dec 2020 and how COVID 19
impacts the company share’s price. We will investigate what kinds of statistical models could
forecast the short term movements of the stock with buying and selling signals.
